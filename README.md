## Quick Start
 Run `_hotbar_trainer.py` to start.\

**Custom Keybinds** <br/>
For custom keybinds, edit `config.txt` with your hotbar keybinds in order separated by semicolons ( ; ). For example, the default would be `1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9;` <br/> <br/>
For special keys like 'caps lock' or 'left shift' simply enter the name of the key (from pygame's list of keycodes) like in this example:  `q;e;f;c;x;z;left shift;caps lock;tab;` <br/> <br/>
The list of pygame's keycodes can be found here [Pygame Keycodes](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html#key-constants-label) <br/> 
[Use the value under the Description column.]
